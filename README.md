JSONPatch is a a swift module implements json-patch [RFC6902](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902). JSONPatch uses [JSONSerialization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsonserialization) from Foundation, and has no dependencies on third-party libraries.

The implementation uses the [JSON Patch Tests](https://github.com/json-patch/json-patch-tests) project for unit tests to validate its correctness.

## Applying Patches
```swift
import JSONPatch

let sourceData = Data("""
                      {"foo": "bar"}
                      """.utf8)
let patchData = Data("""
                     [{"op": "add", "path": "/baz", "value": "qux"}]
                     """.utf8)

let patch = try! JSONPatch(data: patchData)
let patched = try! patch.apply(to: sourceData)
```

## Generating Patches
```swift
import JSONPatch

let sourceData = Data("""
                      {"foo": "bar"}
                      """.utf8)
let targetData = Data("""
                      {"foo": "bar", "baz": "qux"}
                      """.utf8)
let patch = try! JSONPatch(source: sourceData, target: targetData)
let patchData = try! patch.data()
```
